# Dev Dynasty - Pace University Capstone Project

# Project Overview:
The Moodsphere project aims to enhance the music recommendation experience by incorporating user emotions as a key factor in suggesting personalized playlists. Unlike traditional music recommenders who often rely on static factors like genres and artists, this project goes a step further by dynamically adjusting recommendations based on the users current emotional state. The goal is to curate playlists that resonate with the users feelings at a given moment, creating a more engaging and relevant music experience. Using emotion analysis techniques, this project determines the users present emotional state and suggests music that reflects those feelings. This user-centric strategy aims to produce a more engaging and customized music recommendation experience.

The system maintains user profiles that store historical emotional data and music preferences. By continuously learning from user interactions and feedback, the recommender adapts and enhances its understanding of the users evolving emotional states over time. This adaptive user profiling ensures that recommendations become progressively accurate and aligned with the users preferences. The Emotion-Based Music Recommender project seeks to revolutionize music recommendations by recognizing and responding to the dynamic nature of human emotions. By combining advanced emotion analysis techniques with adaptive machine learning models and user-centric design, the project aims to deliver a personalized and emotionally resonant music discovery experience for each user.
